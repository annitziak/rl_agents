# Reinforcement Learning Agents

This repository contains code for multiple RL concepts, such as Dynamic Programming, Tabular Reinforcement Learning, Deep Reinforcement Learning through Deep Q Networks (DQN) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
The goal was to implement, analyze, and extend reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in both discrete and continuous environments using PyTorch.

## ðŸ“š Structure


### **Dynamic Programming** 
- Implemented **Value Iteration** and **Policy Iteration** algorithms.
- Verified correctness using toy MDPs (example with "Frog on a Rock").
- Key file: `exercise1/mdp_solver.py`

### **Tabular Reinforcement Learning**
- Implemented and evaluated agent performance on `FrozenLake8x8-v1` (deterministic and slippery variants).
  - Îµ-greedy action selection.
  - **Q-Learning**
  - **On-policy Every-Visit Monte Carlo**
- Explored and compared hyperparameter profiles with different choices for `gamma`.
- Key files: `exercise2/agents.py`, `train_q_learning.py`, `train_monte_carlo.py`

### **Deep Reinforcement Learning**
- Implemented **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)** with:
  - Epsilon scheduling strategies : including exponential and linear decay.
  - Target network updates
  - Gradient-based updates
- Compared DQN with a tabular discrete agent on the `MountainCar-v0` environment.
- Analyzed the DQN loss and learning behavior.
- Key files: `exercise3/agents.py`, `train_dqn.py`

### **Continuous Control with DDPG** 
- Implemented the **Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)** algorithm for continuous action spaces.
- Trained agents on the `Racetrack` environment from `highway-env`.
- Tuned actor/critic network architectures to achieve competitive performance. Achieved more **stable** results and increased avg reward by **+440** from given baseline.
- Key files: `exercise4/agents.py`, `train_ddpg.py`, `evaluate_ddpg.py`

### **Algorithm Extensions on Tabular Reinforcement Learning**
- Explored other epsilon decay strategies for the `FrozenLake8x8-v1` stochastic variant.
- Explored the differences between Q-learning and SARSA showing that SARSA (being an on-policy algorithm) benefits a lot more for more gradual exploration compared to Q-learning and is able to ouperform it.
- Key files : `sarsa_q_learning.pdf`, `sarsa.py`
